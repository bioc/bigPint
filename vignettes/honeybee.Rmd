Our research paper [Transcriptomic responses to diet quality and viral infection in Apis mellifera](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5767-1) was published in BMC Genomics. We examined how monofloral diet quality and Israeli acute paralysis virus inoculation affected honey bee transcriptomics. Our RNA-seq data was noisy and we used data visualization from the bigPint package to identify noise and robustness in our data. For users interested in additional applications of the bigPint package, please refer to the paper.
